Hi, I'm Jonathan Platt, a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alabama. Learning and applying my knowledge have always been passions of mine and I am excited to share some of the projects I have worked on for school or in my free time.

As a bit more about myself, I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2021. I got involved in research during my freshman year and have continued to be involved ever since. I started out in the Magnetic Materials and Devices Laboratory working on creating a low cost pseudo-doppler direction finding and channel sounding device for the [2018 APS Student Design Contest](https://2018apsursi.org/StudentDesignContest.asp). My team and I were selected as one of 6 teams selected to present at The IEEE AP-S Internations Symposium in Boston, MA and won second place in the contest overall.

Since then, I've worked on developing 3D printed metalic ferrite-resin composites for use in antenna substrates, researched a novel multilayered ferrite-plastic helical antenna, compared radar modulation schemes using a novel simulation method, and designed an FPGA-based m-sequence radar platform. My current research focused on real time simulation of autonomous rovers. Feel free to access any of my published works on my [IEEE Author Profile](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086936899).

Outside of formal research, I am very interested in amateur radio and am actively seeking certification. I also enjoy 3D printing; my Monoprive Select Mini V2 is small but mighty! I am a big proponant of open source software and open access to knowledge. As part of my 2021 AT&T summer internship I made [contributions](https://gerrit.onap.org/r/q/owner:jonathan.platt%2540att.com) to the Linux Foundation's [Open Network Autonmation Project](https://www.onap.org/) (ONAP). I hope to contonue making contributions to open source and sharing my knowledge whenever possible. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my blog!
